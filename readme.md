## HKUST Ph.D. Qualification Exam (PQE) template for Ph.D., especially for ECE 2022 and later

There is no official template for a PQE report in Dept. ECE. Below, there are some highlights of the [official guideline of ECE PQE in 2022](https://course.ece.ust.hk/pginfo/PG_Info_PDF/Guidelines_PhD_PQE_new.pdf), which you may take as a reference if you are preparing for the PQE. The PQE commences normally at the beginning of each semester. There will be approximately one month for PQE report writing and oral presentation preparation, respectively.

Therefore, I modified the template from [Lei TAI's template of the thesis](https://github.com/onlytailei/HKUST_latex_thesis_2019). 

## Usage

The template contains a title page, abstract, three Chapters (Introduction, Proposed Research Direction and Preliminary Work) and one Appendix for the list of figures. And you can find them in the `chapter` folder and figures goes in to the `figures/pqe`.

```shell
    make # building the project
    make clean # clean the by product of building the project
    make distclean # clean the output pdf as well
```
