\chapter{Proposed Direction}
Based on the above investigations over long-term localization\cite{sarlin2019coarse,paton2016bridging} and mapping\cite{qian2022pocd,schmid2022panoptic} algorithms, the proposed directions lie in following three parts. For current map maintenance systems, accurate 6DoF localization is assumed to be solved and provided as a precondition. Therefore, further tests and research on the localization in dynamic scenes are proposed. Regarding the mapping system, multi-experiences localization (MEL)\cite{paton2016bridging} uses multiple traversals information to continuously build topo-metric maps. It proposed a lifelong learning mapping system without considering the large-scale problem, the map size is not scalable over long-term operation. While POCD\cite{qian2022pocd} maintains the map consistent online without considering that the lighting conditions might be changed significantly. Maintenance of multiple maps of the same scene by typical appearance conditions (e.g. day and night, summer and winter) may improve the robustness of long-term navigation.
